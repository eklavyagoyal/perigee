"""Define how a series places its values in time, or state that it does not place them.

TimeF has three axis shapes, closed under :data:`TimeAxis`. :class:`RegularAxis` computes every time
offset from a period and an origin. It stores nothing per value. :class:`IrregularAxis` covers the
placements that no formula produces. It writes down every time offset beside the values.
:class:`OrdinalAxis` records order only. It gives no route to a time offset, so a time question about
one does not type-check.

This module uses two words that are not interchangeable, because the format names two different things:

**time offset**
    A position on a series' own axis. It is an integer microsecond offset from the record's relative
    zero. Every axis quantity here is a time offset, and so are a span's bounds. A time offset says
    where a value sits within its recording. It says nothing about the calendar day. A series with no
    anchor has time offsets and no timestamps.

**timestamp**
    An absolute point on the wall clock, in Unix microseconds. Exactly one field carries one:
    :attr:`~timenet.dataset.Record.start_time`. It is what a record's relative zero refers to.

The wall clock enters once and composes by addition. A value's timestamp is the record's
``start_time`` plus the value's time offset. The recording's own zero anchors the time offset.
The Unix epoch anchors the timestamp.

The period is a :class:`~fractions.Fraction` of microseconds, not a float rate. Not every real
rate is a whole number of them: 360 Hz is 25000/9 us and 256 Hz is 15625/4. A Fraction keeps the
arithmetic exact, so placing a value and locating a time offset are inverse without a tolerance band.
A Fraction also reduces and validates itself.
