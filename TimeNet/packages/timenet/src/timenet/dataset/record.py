    """Reject a span its targeted series cannot place, by the three-part scoping rule.

    A span's bounds are in the source recording timeline, the same frame as each series' axis. Where it
    is allowed to fall depends on what it is scoped to:

    - **Scoped** to named ``time_series_ids``: it claims to apply to every one of them, so it must lie
      inside the *intersection* of their windows. Falling outside even one of those windows breaks
      that claim.
    - **Unscoped** (``time_series_ids`` is ``None``) on a record that declares a ``time_span``: checked
      against that session span. This is how a recording that spans a sensor gap says so. It lets an
      event fall in the gap on purpose, for example a note taken while every sensor was briefly off.
    - **Unscoped** with no ``time_span``: checked against the *union* of the timed series' windows.
      This rejects an event landing in an unrecorded gap instead of silently accepting it. That way, a
      convex hull of the series never masks a hole in the data. Timeless (ordinal) series carry no
      window and drop out.

    Shared by a task's ``scope`` and an annotation so the two never disagree about what a span may cover.

    Args:
        label: Human-readable label for the span, used in the error message.
        span: The span to check.
        time_series: The series the span is checked against.
        record_id: The owning record's id, for the error message.
        time_span: The record's declared session span, if any, consulted only for an unscoped span.
        warn_when_outside: Warn and keep the span when it leaves its window, rather than raise.

    Raises:
        TimeFValidationError: If a series id is unknown. If a scoped span names a timeless series
            or ones whose windows do not overlap. If the record has no timeline for an unscoped
            span. If the span falls outside the window the rule selects, when
            ``warn_when_outside`` is False. If a step span names a series with a timeline, or it runs
            past its steps.
