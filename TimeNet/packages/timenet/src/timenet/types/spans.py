"""Span types: one region a task or annotation localizes, in one of two frames.

A region has two independent traits: its shape (a point or a half-open interval) and its frame (time or
steps). The frame changes what the numbers mean, so the frame is the type. Shape is the same trait run
twice, so it is a subtype within each frame.

A time span reads its bounds as microseconds on the **source recording timeline**, the frame a series'
axis places its values in. This keeps it meaningful on a windowed record that starts partway into the
recording. It covers the whole record, or a subset of series named by ``time_series_ids``.

A step span reads its bounds as ordinal indices into one series' own array. A step index means nothing
without a series to count on, so a step span names exactly one ``time_series_id``. Steps exist for a
series that has no timeline at all: an ordinal sequence has positions but no clock.

The series' axis decides which frame fits it, not the caller. A timeline axis (regular or
irregular) takes a time span. An ordinal axis takes a step span.
:meth:`~timenet.dataset.TimeFDataset.add_task` checks a span against the axis of every series it names.

Build a concrete leaf. The bases (:class:`Span`, :class:`TimeSpan`, :class:`StepSpan`) are abstract, so
every span in circulation carries the shape and frame it means::

    TimePoint.seconds(1.2)              TimeInterval.seconds(5.0, 8.0)
    StepPoint(time_series_id="x", start=5)
    StepInterval(time_series_id="x", start=0, stop=12)
