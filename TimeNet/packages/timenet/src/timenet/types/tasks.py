"""Tasks: labeled training targets that reference one or more records.

Every task has the same shape: inputs give one typed answer. The shared frame lives on the
:class:`Task` base. The base holds the records the task is about, an optional ``prompt``, and an
optional ``scope`` that narrows the input to a region. It also holds the annotations given as
context, the answer (``target``, inline or by reference to stored annotations), and an optional
``rationale`` chain of thought. A subclass adds only what makes its answer a different kind of
thing. That is a category, free text, a number, a set of regions, or a produced series. Prompt and
scope live on the base. So a whole-recording category and a category over a given window are the
same task type, with ``scope`` unset or set. A caption is an :class:`AnswerTask` with no prompt.

The class is the type tag (for example, a filter such as ``search(task=ClassificationTask)``). The
instance carries the payload. Task payload shapes are fixed in code, unlike specs and annotations.
So the reader resolves tasks against the built-in :data:`TASKS` registry. It does not rebuild them
from the manifest. Tasks are mutable, so :meth:`~timenet.dataset.TimeFDataset.add_task` can set
``record_ids`` after construction.
