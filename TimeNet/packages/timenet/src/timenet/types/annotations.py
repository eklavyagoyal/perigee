"""Contextual metadata attached to a record.

One :class:`Annotation` class covers every case. Its optional ``span`` says how the annotation sits
in time. An absent span marks record-scoped context with no place in time, such as demographics or a
ticker symbol. A :class:`~timenet.types.spans.TimePoint` marks one time offset. A
:class:`~timenet.types.spans.TimeInterval` marks a bounded region of the original recording timeline.
:class:`Annotation` is a flat frozen dataclass. It carries ``key``, ``unit``, and ``description`` as
instance fields. A connector can author it directly, or subclass it with field defaults for reuse.
:class:`~timenet.reader.TimeFReader` can rebuild identical instances from the manifest without runtime
class synthesis. :class:`AnnotationDescriptor` is the type-level projection stored in the schema and
manifest.
