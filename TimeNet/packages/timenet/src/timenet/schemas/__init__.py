"""Packaged JSON Schema documents for TimeNet's authored and serialized artifacts.

The schemas describe the wire formats, not the in-memory dataclasses. ``dataset-card.schema.json``
validates the human-authored card YAML (via :meth:`~timenet.types.DatasetMetadata.from_yaml`).
``manifest.schema.json`` is the published contract for the compiled ``manifest.json`` that
:meth:`~timenet.manifest.Manifest.to_dict` produces. A drift test keeps their enum blocks in lockstep
with the Python enums.
