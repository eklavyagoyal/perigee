A connector fetches raw data and converts it into a :class:`~timenet.dataset.TimeFDataset`. It has no
knowledge of the registry, engine, or any other connector. The engine drives it
``download -> convert``, then stores the result itself. The consumer SDK never imports connector
code: it builds only through the ``timenet.builders`` entry point.
