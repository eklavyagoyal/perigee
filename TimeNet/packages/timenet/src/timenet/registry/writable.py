"""Define the writable-registry contract for a backend that build publishes datasets into.

This class extends the read-only :class:`~timenet.registry.BaseRegistry` with one write primitive,
:meth:`WritableRegistry.store`. Backends differ only in where a compiled dataset lands, for example a
local directory, an S3 prefix, or a remote service. So ``store`` is the one abstract method, and
:meth:`exists` is shared.
