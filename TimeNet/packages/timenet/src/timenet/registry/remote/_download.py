"""Parallel, atomic download of a whole dataset version into a local directory.

Resolves each file's presigned URL and streams it concurrently into a staging directory, bounded by a
semaphore. A single rename then swaps the staging directory into place, so an interrupted download
never replaces a good copy. The download is async under the hood (httpx ``AsyncClient``).
:func:`download_version_files` is the synchronous entry point. It runs the coroutine even from inside a
running event loop.
