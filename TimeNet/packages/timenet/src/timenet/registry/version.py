"""The :class:`DatasetVersion` handle: a random-access, picklable view of one committed version.

The registry hands one of these back from :meth:`~timenet.registry.BaseRegistry.open_version`, and the
reader (with the values backends) reads straight through it. It bundles the already-parsed manifest with
a pyarrow filesystem and the version's root prefix on that filesystem. A read never re-opens the registry
or re-parses ``manifest.json``. The filesystem is config-only (a
:class:`pyarrow.fs.LocalFileSystem` today, a :class:`pyarrow.fs.S3FileSystem` later), so the whole handle
pickles and a torch ``DataLoader`` can ship it to a worker.
