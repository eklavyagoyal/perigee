"""``timenet-build``: the producer CLI that runs connectors through the engine.

This is not the consumer ``timenet`` CLI. A ``build`` writes a dataset-layout directory that the SDK
can load. That directory is a valid local registry. The CLI resolves connectors by dataset id at run
time. To add one, drop a ``datasets/<org>/<name>/`` package with a ``connector.py`` that exposes
``CONNECTOR`` and a ``dataset.yaml`` card. You do not register it here.
