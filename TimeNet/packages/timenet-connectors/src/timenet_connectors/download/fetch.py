"""High-level, scheme-dispatching downloads for connectors.

:func:`download_files` downloads a list of :class:`~timenet_connectors.download.http.Artifact`, choosing the
backend from each URL's scheme so a connector never branches on ``s3://`` vs ``http(s)://`` itself. A
single file is a one-element list. :func:`ensure_archive` builds on it to download a zip archive,
extract it once, and delete the archive. S3 objects go through boto3
(:mod:`~timenet_connectors.download.s3`) and HTTP through httpx
(:mod:`~timenet_connectors.download.http`). Both are async so they compose with a connector's
``download_async``. The S3 branch is a plain blocking call, because boto3 already parallelizes a single
object's transfer. A list mixing schemes runs its S3 entries one at a time and its HTTP entries
concurrently. Progress flows through the ambient :mod:`~timenet_connectors.download.progress` sink, so
neither takes a progress argument. :func:`find_dir_containing` locates a file inside an extracted
tree, whose layout differs from archive to archive.
