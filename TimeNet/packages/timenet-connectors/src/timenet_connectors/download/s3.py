"""Download an ``s3://bucket/key`` object for connectors.

This helper downloads an ``s3://bucket/key`` object to a local path with boto3, which runs the transfer
in parallel with multipart downloads. When AWS credentials are configured (environment, ``AWS_PROFILE``
/ the shared ``~/.aws`` config / SSO, container and instance roles), the client uses them, so a private
source stays reachable. When none are configured, it reads anonymously, which is what a public bucket
such as physionet-open needs. The code imports ``boto3`` lazily, so users who build only offline
datasets do not need it.
