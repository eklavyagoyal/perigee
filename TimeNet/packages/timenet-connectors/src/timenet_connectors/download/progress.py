"""Download-progress reporting for connectors.

Downloads report progress through an ambient sink rather than a callback threaded down every layer.
A caller (the ``timenet-build`` CLI, or a test) installs a sink with :func:`progress_sink`. The
download helpers deep in the stack call :func:`report_progress`. The event then surfaces without the
connector, the engine, or any intermediate function growing a ``progress`` parameter. The sink is a
:class:`~contextvars.ContextVar`, so it propagates correctly across ``asyncio.run`` and into gathered
tasks. Concurrent downloads on the single event-loop thread deliver their events serially.
