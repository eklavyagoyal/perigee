"""Concurrent async HTTP downloads for connectors.

:func:`download_http` fetches one URL. :func:`download_http_many` fetches a list of :class:`Artifact`
with the number of parallel downloads bounded by ``max_concurrency``. Both stream responses to disk with
``aiofiles`` (no whole-file buffering, so multi-GB archives stay off the heap) and write atomically.
The bytes land in a ``.part`` file, and a rename moves it into place only on success. So an interrupted
download never leaves a truncated file that a later ``skip_existing`` check would trust. Each artifact
carries its own headers and cookies, which merge over the batch-level ones, so one call can span hosts
that need different auth.
