# the two nights of that subject.

# Every recording id here is invented. Each one keeps the shape of a real id, because the parser
# needs that shape. A real id is three study characters, two subject digits, a night, and two
# more characters. No id here names a recording of the release. Every subject number is more
# than 89, and the release numbers no subject that high. The age, the sex, the clock times and
# the header names are invented in the same way.
