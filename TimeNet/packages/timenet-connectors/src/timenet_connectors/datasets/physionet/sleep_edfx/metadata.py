"""Build the annotations that state where a recording sits and who was in the bed.

Every function here takes values and gives annotations. Nothing here opens a file or takes a
path. ``connector.py`` reads the release and the subject tables, then passes the values it read.
A test can call these functions with values alone.

Some facts repeat across the release. The study, the night number, the sex and the drug
condition each come from a set that the release fixes. One annotation covers every record that
states that value. :class:`MetadataAnnotation` holds one instance for each value. The writer
keys its annotation table by id, and lists the records that carry each one. Many records that
share one annotation write one row.

The age, the note and the lights-off time measure one recording. Each record gets its own.

An annotation with a span is always per-record. One shared annotation carries one span, and
these spans differ for each recording.
