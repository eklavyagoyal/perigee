"""Build the tasks of one recording from the annotations it already carries.

Nothing here opens a file. ``connector.py`` passes the annotations, and every function takes
values and gives tasks.

No task names its own id. Nothing resolves one by id: the writer fills ``Record.task_ids`` from
the task itself, and no task here states a lineage. Every task takes the generated id.

A ``target_schema`` is a different thing. It must equal the id of the registered annotation that
holds the set, so ``name_vocabulary`` builds both from one string.

No task carries a prompt. The release states no question in words.
