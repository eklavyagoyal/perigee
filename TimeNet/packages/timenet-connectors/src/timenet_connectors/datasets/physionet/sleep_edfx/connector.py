"""The Sleep-EDF connector: whole-night polysomnograms with expert sleep scoring.

One record is one recording. A recording is a ``*-PSG.edf`` file of body signals with a
``*-Hypnogram.edf`` file beside it. A technician scored that hypnogram in epochs of 30 s.

The release holds two studies. ``sleep-cassette`` measured the effect of age on sleep. It
recorded each subject at home, on a cassette recorder. ``sleep-telemetry`` measured the effect
of temazepam. It recorded each subject in hospital, on a telemetry system.

The two studies used different equipment. As a result, their signal sets differ. Their spans
differ too. A cassette recording covers about a day, and a telemetry recording about ten hours.

The loop that walks the release is in ``convert``, so one place states what a record is made of.
:mod:`~timenet_connectors.bases.edf.reader` reads the EDF container, and
:mod:`~timenet_connectors.datasets.physionet.sleep_edfx.specs` states what each signal measures.

:mod:`~timenet_connectors.datasets.physionet.sleep_edfx.tables` turns the rows of a subject table
into the facts it states, behind one reader that a per-sheet description drives.
:mod:`~timenet_connectors.datasets.physionet.sleep_edfx.metadata` turns the values that the header
and the table state into annotations.

No two facts about a recording come from the same place. The directory names the study. The
filename names the night. The EDF header states the clock and a second reading of the age and the
sex of the subject. The subject table states the age, the sex and the lights-off time. For
telemetry it states the drug condition in the shape of its columns and nowhere else.
