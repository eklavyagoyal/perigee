"""Read the EDF container: the header of a file, and one data record from it.

EDF holds an ASCII header and then data records of 16-bit integers. One record holds the
samples of every signal for one stretch of time, one signal after the other. Signals of
different rates therefore hold a different count of samples in the same record.

This module parses no bytes. ``edfio`` does that. A connector that reads EDF declares
``edfio`` in its ``requirements.txt``.

:class:`EdfHeader` and :class:`EdfFile` are the boundary: ``edfio`` types stay inside this
file, thus a later change of library does not reach the modules that call it.
