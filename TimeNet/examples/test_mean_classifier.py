"""End-to-end TimeNet example: build a dataset, load it, and train a classifier.

The task is deliberately simple: each record in ``timenet/test-mean`` is one noisy signal, labeled by
whether its mean is above or below zero. The script runs the whole loop top to bottom: build the
dataset from its connector into the local registry, load it back through the SDK, turn the records into
an ``(X, y)`` training pair, and train a scikit-learn classifier.

scikit-learn is not a TimeNet dependency. Run it with uv, which pulls scikit-learn in for this one
command without adding it to your environment. From the repo root::

    uv run --with scikit-learn examples/test_mean_classifier.py
