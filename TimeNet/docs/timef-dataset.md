# TimeFDataset

`TimeFDataset` is the in-memory model that a connector populates during `convert()`. It holds records
and their tasks as Python objects. `TimeFDataset` does no I/O. The [`TimeFWriter`](timef-writer.md)
handles persistence. `TimeFDataset` lives in `timenet.dataset`.

---

## TimeSeries

A `TimeSeries` is a reference to one logical stream of time-series data. It supports optional
windowing and a lazy Arrow loader.

```python
from timenet.dataset import TimeSeries
from timenet.dataset.axis import RegularAxis

TimeSeries(
    spec=vibration,           # a TimeSeriesSpec (the modality)
    signal="axial",           # the signal this series carries
    time_axis=RegularAxis.from_rate_hz(500),
    # Callable[[], pa.Array] matching the spec's dtype and value_shape
    loader=load_axial,
    source_id="rec_001",      # optional
    n_values=5000,            # how many values the loader will return
)
```

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `spec` | `TimeSeriesSpec` | yes | The modality (shared across signals). |
| `signal` | `str` | yes | The logical stream name (for example `"axial"` or `"rgb_frames"`). |
| `time_axis` | `TimeAxis` | yes | Where the values sit in time: `RegularAxis`, `IrregularAxis`, or `OrdinalAxis`. |
| `n_values` | `int` | yes | How many values the series holds. The writer validates the loader against this number. |
| `loader` | `Callable[[], pa.Array]` | yes | A lazy loader that returns scalar values or an Arrow fixed-shape tensor array. |
| `source_id` | `str \| None` | no | Identifier of the raw recording that this series came from. |
| `time_series_id` | `str` | no | Persistent handle (auto uuid7). The writer dedupes by it. |
| `time_offsets_loader` | `Callable[[], pa.Array] \| None` | no | One int64 microsecond time offset per value. `IrregularAxis` requires this field. Other axis types reject it. |

`TimeSeries` is frozen and uses identity equality (`eq=False`). The writer dedupes by
`time_series_id`. If a connector reuses one instance, or gives two instances the same explicit ID,
both collapse to one chunk on disk.
Consumers read values through `to_arrow()` (Arrow, zero-copy) or `to_numpy()`. The connector supplies
`loader` at build. [`TimeFReader`](timef-reader.md) supplies `loader` again on read-back. In both
cases, `loader` remains the lazy boundary. `read_steps(start, stop)` lets range-aware storage loaders
select a temporal subsection, then return it as Arrow. Older connector callables do not support this.
They fall back to a full-read slice.

`TimeSeriesSpec.dtype`, `value_shape`, and `dimension_names` describe one timestep. Scalar series keep
the defaults `float32`, `()`, and `()`. An RGB camera, for example, uses `dtype="uint8"`,
`value_shape=(height, width, 3)`, and names `("height", "width", "color")`. A text signal uses
`dtype="str"`, and a categorical signal uses `dtype="enum"`. The full
logical shape is always `(n_steps, *value_shape)`.

If a connector already holds the values in memory, use the classmethod
`TimeSeries.from_values(values, *, spec, signal, time_axis, source_id=None, time_series_id=None)`.
This method wraps the values in a loader cast to the spec's dtype. For a `"str"` or `"enum"` spec,
pass the labels and the loader keeps them as text. It takes `n_values` from the length of the array.
If a series stores time offsets instead of computing them, use
`TimeSeries.from_irregular(values, *, time_offsets_us, ...)`. This method derives the axis from the
stream, so the two values cannot disagree. Use the `loader=` constructor above only for lazy sources
(files, remote shards).

`from_values()` and `from_irregular()` convert the values once and retain the resulting Arrow array.
Repeated reads reuse that array without repeating the conversion.
If you supply a loader, that loader controls its own reads and stored results.
The constructors still use NumPy to convert numeric NumPy inputs.
Enum inputs use dictionary encoding, which stores each distinct label once.
The constructors compare those distinct labels with the declared categories.

An **ordinal** series has positions but no clock. It is an ordered sequence, for example `TSQA`, whose
values carry an order but no calendar time. Build it with an `OrdinalAxis`. An ordinal series has no
rate and no timeline. As a result, a task on this series uses steps instead of seconds for its scope
and forecast (see [tasks](data-model/tasks.md)).

```python
from timenet.dataset import TimeSeries
from timenet.dataset.axis import OrdinalAxis

# TSQA: an ordered sequence of values with no wall clock
series = TimeSeries.from_values(
    values,                       # the ordered values
    spec=tsqa_spec,
    signal="series",
    time_axis=OrdinalAxis(),
    time_series_id="tsqa",
)
```

## Record

A `Record` is one logical unit of time-series data, for example a recording, a session, a sensor
bundle, or a market window. A connector creates it with `TimeFDataset.add_record`.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `record_id` | `str` | Auto uuid7 (or explicit, for deterministic output). |
| `time_series` | `tuple[TimeSeries, ...]` | The record's logical streams. |
| `subject_ids` | `tuple[str, ...]` | Subjects (empty for subject-less domains). |
| `task_ids` | `tuple[str, ...]` | Ids of tasks attached via `add_task` (populated after construction). |
| `annotations` | `tuple[Annotation, ...]` | Attached via `add_annotation`. |
| `start_time` | `datetime \| int \| None` | The wall-clock anchor that relative time zero refers to, for every series and annotation in the record. Pass a timezone-aware `datetime` or a whole number of Unix microseconds. Construction normalizes either value to microseconds. `Record` rejects a bare float, because both seconds and microseconds are plausible readings of it. `None` means no wall-clock reference exists, for example for de-identified or synthetic data. If no wall-clock reference exists, do not invent one. |
| `time_span` | `TimeInterval \| None` | The overall span of the session on the source recording timeline. Some recordings have series with gaps between them. An unscoped span, for example a note taken while every sensor was briefly off, can fall inside such a gap. `time_span` must carry no `time_series_ids`. It must contain every series' window. When `time_span` is set, `Record` validates an unscoped span against it instead of against the union of the series' windows. |

All series and annotations in an anchored record share this clock and relative-time coordinate system.
Use `record.has_absolute_time` to find out whether the anchor is known.

`add_annotation(annotation)` attaches the annotation and returns it. It validates a temporal
annotation's span with the same rule that a task's `scope` uses. A span scoped to named
`time_series_ids` must lie inside the *intersection* of those series' windows. If an unscoped span
declares a `time_span`, `add_annotation` validates the span against the record's `time_span`.
Otherwise, `add_annotation` validates the span against the *union* of the series' windows. A span
that leaves the window this rule selects warns with `SpanOutsideWindowWarning` and is kept as it was
given. Some sources state a region that reaches past the signals it was written for, and a connector
records what the source says. Pass `warn_when_outside=False` to raise `TimeFValidationError` instead.
The reader keeps the same default, so it reads back a span the writer accepted.

`add_annotations([...])` attaches an iterable the same way, but as one all-or-nothing operation. It
validates the whole batch first. It leaves the record untouched if any annotation fails.

`to_arrow()` and `to_numpy()` return the sole signal's 1-D values (Arrow or NumPy) for the common
single-signal record. For a multi-signal record, both methods raise `ValueError`. In that case, index
`time_series` directly.

---

## TimeFDataset

```python
from timenet.dataset import TimeFDataset

dataset = TimeFDataset(metadata=metadata)
record = dataset.add_record(time_series=(...), subject_ids=("p1",))
dataset.add_task(record, ClassificationTask(target="faulty"))
dataset.derive_schema()
```

### `add_record()`

```python
add_record(
    *, time_series, subject_ids=(),
    record_id=None, start_time=None, time_span=None,
) -> Record
```

`add_record` creates a record, registers it, and returns it. It raises `TimeFValidationError` if
`time_series` is empty. Pass `record_id` for deterministic output, for example for golden fixtures.
Pass `start_time` to anchor the record's relative timeline to wall-clock time. With this anchor, a
caller can synchronize records across datasets and devices.

### `add_task()` / `add_tasks()`

```python
add_task(records, task) -> Task
add_tasks(records, tasks) -> tuple[Task, ...]
```

`add_task` and `add_tasks` register a task, or a batch of tasks, against the same record or records.
`add_task` populates each task's `record_ids`. It appends each task's `id` to every target record's
`task_ids`. Put `scope` and `from_tasks` on the task itself. These fields describe that one task, not
the call.

`add_task` validates a task against its records at this point, because it is the first point that has
both a task and its records. `add_task` raises `TimeFValidationError` in these cases:

- `records` is empty.
- A task sets both `target` and `target_annotation_ids`, or sets neither, unless its answer is a
  produced series.
- A [`Span`](types.md#span) (the `scope` or a localization target) has `time_series_ids` that do not
  resolve on every target record. A span that falls outside a record's covered span warns with
  `SpanOutsideWindowWarning` and is kept, the same way an annotation's span is.
- An `input_annotation_ids` or `target_annotation_ids` entry names an annotation that no target record
  carries.

`add_tasks` is all-or-nothing. It validates the whole batch before it attaches any task. If one task is
bad, `add_tasks` raises an error and leaves the dataset untouched. To keep tasks that were added before
a failure, call `add_task` in a loop instead.

Validation of the whole batch also enforces relationships across the batch:

- Task ids stay unique against the batch and the dataset.
- Every `from_tasks` parent already exists in the dataset, or the batch includes it.
- No task derives from itself or closes a cycle.

As a result, a task can derive from another task in the same call, regardless of order.

### `derive_schema()`

```python
derive_schema() -> DatasetSchema
```

`derive_schema` walks the dataset's instances and builds its
[`DatasetSchema`](types.md#datasetschema). The schema holds the distinct specs, annotation
descriptors, and task types, deduplicated in the original order. `derive_schema` stores the result in
`dataset.schema` and returns it. It never reads series values. The engine calls `derive_schema` after
`convert()` and before the writer runs.

### Properties

`TimeFDataset` exposes these properties:

- `metadata`
- `records` (tuple, read-only)
- `tasks` (tuple, read-only)
- `schema` (`DatasetSchema | None`). This is `None` until `derive_schema()` runs, or until the reader
  populates it.

### `tasks_of()` / `tasks_for()`

```python
tasks_of(task_type) -> tuple[Task, ...]
tasks_for(record, task_type=Task) -> tuple[Task, ...]
```

`tasks_of` returns every task of a type across the dataset. `tasks_for` resolves one record's
`task_ids` back to task objects. `tasks_for` can filter the result by type.

### `to_features_and_targets()`

```python
to_features_and_targets(*, task=None, output="arrow", features="timestep")
    -> tuple[pa.Array, pa.Array] | tuple[np.ndarray, np.ndarray]
```

`to_features_and_targets` builds an `(X, y)` training pair. **By default, it defers
materialization.**

The `features` parameter picks the shape of `X`:

- `"timestep"` (the default) gives one feature per point. This is a rectangular
  `FixedSizeListArray[T]` (or `(n, T)`) matrix, and it needs records of equal length.
- `"series"` gives one sequence per record. This is a `ListArray` (or `(n,)`) object array, and it
  also handles series of variable length.

The `output` parameter picks how `to_features_and_targets` builds the arrays:

- `output="arrow"` (the default) builds the arrays directly from the loaders, with no NumPy copy.
- `output="numpy"` materializes the arrays.

`to_features_and_targets` infers `task` when the dataset has exactly one target-bearing type.
Otherwise, pass `task` explicitly. Note that `ForecastingTask` has no scalar target.

### `describe()`

```python
describe(*, rows=5, file=None) -> None
```

`describe` prints a plain-text summary, similar to the `describe` and `info` methods in pandas. The
summary includes identity, counts, per-spec columns (name, units, and the value dtype sampled from
one series), and a preview of the first `rows` records. The preview reads only span metadata, so it
never loads series values. `describe` works before `derive_schema()` runs, because it computes all
figures from the records. `describe` needs no CLI or `rich` dependency. It writes to `file`
(`sys.stdout` by default).

```python
TimeNet().load("chengsenwang/tsqa").describe()
```
