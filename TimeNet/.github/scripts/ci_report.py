"""Upsert the single sticky CI comment on a pull request.

Called by the ``check`` job of ``.github/workflows/pre-commit-hooks.yaml`` once the tiers it
depends on have run. It reads their results from the environment, renders one Markdown report,
appends that to the job summary, and then creates or updates exactly one PR comment.

The comment is found by :data:`MARKER` rather than by "the last comment from this token", so a run
never edits somebody else's comment and never stacks up a new one per push. A first-time passing run
writes no comment at all; only a failure opens one, and later runs keep editing it in place.

The script declares its own dependencies inline, so ``--no-project`` keeps it off the workspace
environment: the ``check`` job never syncs one. Run it the way CI does::

    QUICK=success TESTS=success TESTS_MIN=success uv run --no-project \
        .github/scripts/ci_report.py
